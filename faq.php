                  <ul><li><strong>Wash your hands</strong> often with plain soap and water. The CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe1b47b1-a7be-4c0c-8612-c7dbe7dbcad3" href="/consumers/consumer-updates/safely-using-hand-sanitizer" title="Safely Using Hand Sanitizer">Learn more about safely using hand sanitizer</a>.</li>

                  <p>A: The CDC recommends wearing masks in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.&nbsp;Effective February 2, 2021, masks are required on planes, buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation traveling into, within, or out of the United States and in U.S. transportation hubs such as airports and stations. Read more about the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html">Mask Requirement</a>.</p>

                  <p>The FDA has authorized the emergency use of face masks, including cloth face coverings, that meet certain criteria for use as source control by the general public and health care personnel in accordance with CDC recommendations during the COVID-19 public health emergency. The FDA also regulates other medical devices, including personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks and N95 respirators. The CDC recommends that PPE should be reserved for use by health care workers, first responders, and other frontline workers whose jobs put them at much greater risk of acquiring COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A: On October 22, 2020, the FDA approved the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a healthcare setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>This approval does not include the entire population that had been authorized to use Veklury under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) originally issued on May 1, 2020. In order to ensure continued access to the pediatric population previously covered under the EUA, the FDA revised the EUA for Veklury to permit the drug’s use by licensed healthcare providers for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized pediatric patients 3.5 kg to less than 40 kg <strong><em>or</em></strong> hospitalized pediatric patients less than 12 years of age weighing at least 3.5 kg. For additional information on the authorized use of Veklury under the EUA, refer to the <a data-entity-substitution="media_download" data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="27a9c4e9-a6d6-445a-9c5d-350182f2872f" href="/media/137566/download" title="Remdesivir EUA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers - updated October 22, 2020">Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</a>.</p>

                <p>Clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of Veklury (remdesivir) in this pediatric patient population are ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The National Institutes of Health provides more information about <a href="https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/">treatment options</a>.</p>

                <p>People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.</p>

                <p>A:&nbsp;The best way to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is by washing your hands with plain soap and water, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/">advises the CDC</a>. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one’s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A:&nbsp;Many retail stores and pharmacies sell hand sanitizers. However, we understand that many stores may not have hand sanitizers available to buy. To help increase the availability of hand sanitizers, the FDA has issued <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a575d1dd-96f4-4faf-ab43-09e46aca7c6d" href="/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-temporary-policy-preparation-certain-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizer-products-during" title="Guidance for Industry: Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19) ">guidance</a> for the temporary preparation of alcohol-based hand sanitizers by some companies and pharmacies during the&nbsp;COVID-19 public health emergency.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The FDA does not recommend that consumers make their own hand sanitizer. If made incorrectly, hand sanitizer can be ineffective, and there have been reports of skin burns from homemade hand sanitizer. The agency lacks verifiable information on the methods being used to prepare hand sanitizer at home and whether they are safe for use on human skin.</p>

                <p>A: Yes. Data shows that when compared to never smokers, cigarette smoking increases the risk of more severe illness from COVID-19, which could result in hospitalization, the need for intensive care, or even death. Smoking cigarettes can&nbsp;cause inflammation and cell damage throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making it less able to fight off disease.<br><br>
                There’s never been a better time to quit smoking. If you need resources to help you quit smoking, the FDA’s <a href="https://smokefree.gov/everytrycounts/">Every Try Counts</a> campaign has supportive tips and tools to help you get closer to quitting for good.</p>

                <p>Call the vaccination provider or your health care provider if you have any side effects that bother you or do not go away. Report vaccine side effects to FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The VAERS toll-free number is 1-800-822-7967 or report online to <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html</a>. Please include the name of the vaccine in the first line of box #18 of the report form.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>You may also be given an option to enroll in <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vsafe">v-safe</a>. V-safe is a new voluntary smartphone-based tool that uses text messaging and web surveys to check in with people who have been vaccinated to identify potential side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. V-safe asks questions that help CDC monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. V-safe also provides second-dose reminders if needed and live telephone follow-up by CDC if participants report a significant health impact following COVID-19 vaccination.

                <p>A: There are no authorized COVID-19 antigen or molecular tests that specifically report the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. Currently, COVID-19 tests are designed to check broadly for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. &nbsp;It is common for all viruses to change and mutate over time, resulting in different virus strains. The FDA works closely with test developers to identify potential impacts of virus mutations on FDA authorized COVID-19 tests and help ensure there is minimal impact on test performance.</p>

                <p>Local, state, and federal public health agencies, including the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, track the SARS-CoV-2 virus variants so we can understand which strains of the virus are spreading.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Health care providers treat patients who have COVID-19 based on the patient’s symptoms and not based on the strain of virus.&nbsp;For more information on treatment options see <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4cd9bfff-f522-454d-b8d4-5b2bc5098942" href="/consumers/consumer-updates/know-your-treatment-options-covid-19" title="Know Your Treatment Options for COVID-19">Know Your Treatment Options for COVID-19</a> and discuss your symptoms with a health care provider.</p>
